# README

gopeaks is a simple peak caller for CUT&TAG data implemented in goalng

## Overview

Calculate coverage set.. reads overlapping regions with bin size (bin 100, step 50)

#Subtract IGG

Calculate total coverage (sum all reads?)

Calculate mean reads/bin /total coverage 

Map with binomial probability for each count value

Filter bins if binomial probability suggests they have more than expected

Merge ol peaks / cluster nearby

Write output peaks bed file and output bw
